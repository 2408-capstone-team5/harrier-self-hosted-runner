## Using Harrier

### Deploying Harrier Infrastructure

Run the **Harrier-setup** GitHub Action to deploy the necessary AWS resources.

### Using Self-Hosted Runners

Update workflows to use Harrier‚Äôs self-hosted runners by replacing `ubuntu-22.04` or `ubuntu-latest` with `self-hosted`.

```yml
name: CI
on: push

jobs:
   build:
     runs-on: self-hosted
```

### Persistent Caching in Workflows

Use Harrier‚Äôs caching features to optimize workflow execution by using predefined cache keys and locations.

---

## Teardown

### Destroying Harrier Infrastructure

To remove all Harrier-related resources, run the **Harrier-cleanup** action.

**‚ö† Warning**:  
This action permanently deletes all resources and data. Use with caution. To start fresh, you can re-run the setup process.

## Deployment and Management

Harrier will deploy resources for you in your own AWS account, providing secure integration with your GitHub organization through OIDC standards and AWS Secrets Manager. You will never give any sensitive information, including passwords or keys, to Harrier.

To begin, follow the steps in the Installation section below to configure your AWS and GitHub to work together. You'll establis an identity provider and role in AWS IAM, generate your own personal access token in GitHub, and save it in your AWS Secrets Manager to allow your repo code to access your AWS.

Once these configurations are complete, you'll use the `Try Harrier` feature to get your setup YAML file. Just specify your configuration preferences, or rely on smart default values. Then you will receive a setup.yml file, which you'll copy and pasted into a new workflow action in any repository within your GitHub organization. Executing this workflow will deploy your new self-hosted runners in your AWS, fully at your service and control.

Your new action based on the setup.yml first automates preparatory tasks such as setting up Node.js and configuring AWS credentials with the user's designated IAM role. Once the groundwork is complete, the action executes the Harrier Setup Action from the GitHub public marketplace. Harrier Setup is a JavaScript packed action which deploys the required infrastructure using code from the action repository. The project is open-source which means that anyone can browse and check the code and functionality before executing.

Using your new self-hosted runner is a simple one-line change in any workflow:

üö´ `- ubuntu-latest`  
‚úÖ `+ self-hosted`

### Deploying Harrier

To have Harrier deploy your AWS infra resources, run the Harrier-setup action

### Using Harrier self-hosted runners in your GitHub Actions workflows

### Using Harrier persistent cache in your GitHub Actions workflows

### Destroying Harrier Infrastructure

To tear down the Harrier infrastructure from your AWS, run the Harrier-cleanup action

This action will delete all Harrier-related resources in your AWS account.
